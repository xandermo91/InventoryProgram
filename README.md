# InventoryProgram

This project is an exercise on using JavaFX and Java. I found this program to be easy, intuitive, and enjoyable.

This program is for a user to create an inventory of products and parts. There are several options to choose from when inputting different objects. The products are made up of parts.

The first scene is the main scene that gives the user the option to ADD, MODIFY, or REMOVE a part or product. There is a search bar that helps find a particular part or product.

The ADD button for either part or product takes the user to a scene where all the textboxes are blank and the user can fill them out with new information. As soon as the user is done and presses the button ADD, the part/product is added to the application and the object is seen in their respective lists. The MODIFY button only works when a part or product is selected. the MODIFY scene is much like the ADD scene, except that the textboxes are already populated with the information of the selected part or product. The DELETE button only works when a part or product is selected, and removes the part or product from the list.

The user can exit the program by pressing the EXIT button or the X on the top right corner of the window.
